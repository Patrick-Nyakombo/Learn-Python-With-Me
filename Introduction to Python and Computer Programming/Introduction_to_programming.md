## How Does a Computer Program Work?

A program makes a computer usable. Without a program, even the most powerful computer is merely an object. Similarly, without a player, a piano is simply a wooden box.
Computers can perform highly complex tasks, but this capability is not inherent. The true nature of a computer is quite different.
It can only execute very simple operations. For instance, a computer cannot independently determine the value of a complicated mathematical function, although this may become possible in the future.
Modern computers can only perform basic operations like addition or division, but they do so extremely quickly and can repeat these actions countless times.
Imagine you want to know the average speed during a long journey. You know the distance and the time, and you need the speed.
While a computer can calculate this, it doesnâ€™t inherently understand concepts like distance, speed, or time. Therefore, you need to instruct the computer to:

- Accept a number representing the distance.
- Accept a number representing the travel time.
- Divide the distance by the time and store the result.
- Display the result (the average speed) in a readable format.
  
These four simple actions constitute a program. Though these steps are not formalized and far from what a computer directly understands, they can be translated into a language that the computer can process.
**Language** is the keyword.
