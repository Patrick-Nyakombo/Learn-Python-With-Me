## 1.1.1 How Does a Computer Program Work?

A program makes a computer usable. Without a program, even the most powerful computer is merely an object. Similarly, without a player, a piano is simply a wooden box.

Computers can perform highly complex tasks, but this capability is not inherent. The true nature of a computer is quite different.

It can only execute very simple operations. For instance, a computer cannot independently determine the value of a complicated mathematical function, although this may become possible in the future.

Modern computers can only perform basic operations like addition or division, but they do so extremely quickly and can repeat these actions countless times.

Imagine you want to know the average speed during a long journey. You know the distance and the time, and you need the speed.

While a computer can calculate this, it doesn’t inherently understand concepts like distance, speed, or time. Therefore, you need to instruct the computer to:

- Accept a number representing the distance.
- Accept a number representing the travel time.
- Divide the distance by the time and store the result.
- Display the result (the average speed) in a readable format.
  
These four simple actions constitute a program. Though these steps are not formalized and far from what a computer directly understands, they can be translated into a language that the computer can process.

**Language** is the keyword.

## 1.1.2 Natural Languages vs Programming Languages

Language is a tool for expressing and preserving thoughts. It surrounds us in various forms, some of which don’t involve speaking or writing. For instance, body language allows you to convey profound emotions without uttering a single word.

Another language you rely on daily is your native tongue, used to express your thoughts and engage with the world. Similarly, computers have their own form of communication called **machine language**. It is a basic and highly structured system.

Even the most advanced computer lacks any trace of intelligence. It operates like a well-trained dog, responding only to a predefined set of commands it has been programmed to recognize.

These commands are simple and could be likened to instructions such as "take a number, add it to another number, and store the result."

The full collection of commands a computer can process is called an **instruction list**, often abbreviated as IL. This set varies between different computer models, with each having its own unique commands and structure.

It’s important to note that machine languages are a human creation. While no computer can currently invent its own language, this capability might emerge in the future.

Just as humans use a wide range of languages, computers operate with multiple machine languages. However, unlike machine languages, which are deliberately designed, human languages have evolved naturally.

Human languages continue to change, with new words being created and old ones fading away. These evolving forms of communication are known as **natural languages**.

## 1.1.3 What makes a language

- **Alphabet**: this is a set of symbols used to build words in a certain language.
- **Lexis**: also known as a dictionary, it is a set of words that a language offers to its users. For example the word "cable" comes from the English dictionary while "bcela" does not.
- **Syntax**: this is a set of rules used to determine if specific string of words form a valid sentence. For example "I am a hero" is a correct syntax in the English language while "I a hero am" is not.
- **Semantics**: this is a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense. For example "I took a cup of coffee" makes sense while "A cup of coffee took me" does not.

## 1.1.4 Machine Language vs High Level-Language

The instruction list (IL) can be considered as **the alphabet of a machine language**. It is the most basic and fundamental set of symbols used to communicate commands to a computer. It is essentially the computer's native language.

However, this native language is vastly different from a human mother tongue. To bridge the gap between the worlds of humans and computers, a common language is necessary, one that allows humans to write programs in a way that computers can execute effectively. This language must be far more advanced than machine language yet significantly simpler than natural language.

These languages are known as high-level programming languages. They share some similarities with natural languages, as they use symbols, words, and conventions that are more comprehensible to humans. High-level languages enable people to issue instructions to computers that are far more sophisticated than the basic commands provided by ILs.

A program written in a high-level programming language is called **source code**, distinguishing it from the machine code that computers execute. The file containing this source code is referred to as the **source file**.

## 1.1.5 Compilation vs Interpretation

Computer programming involves arranging the components of a chosen programming language in a specific sequence to produce a desired outcome. The nature of this outcome varies depending on the programmer's creativity, expertise, and experience.

To achieve this, the composition must be correct in several key aspects:

1. **Alphabetical**: The program must use a recognized script, such as Roman or Cyrillic characters.
2. **Lexical**: Each programming language has its own set of words and symbols, much like a dictionary, and these must be used correctly. Fortunately, these dictionaries are far smaller and simpler than those of natural languages.
3. **Syntactical**: Programs must follow the structural rules of the language, ensuring proper arrangement of its elements.
4. **Semantical**: The program must convey meaningful instructions that align with the intended outcome.

Mistakes in any of these areas can render a program ineffective or completely unusable.

Once a program is written successfully, the next step is to have the computer execute it. For this, the program must be converted into machine language, the computer's native tongue. Fortunately, computers themselves handle this translation process, making it both quick and efficient.

There are two primary methods for translating a high-level programming language into machine language:
- **Compilation**: here the source program is translated once by getting a file containing the machine code. However, this act must be repeated each time you update the source code. The file can then be distributed worldwide and the program is translated by a **compiler** or a **translator**.
- **Interpretation**: here a user can translate the source code each time it need to be run. The program performing this kind of transformation is called an **interpreter**, it interpretes the code everytime it is intended to be executed. This also implies that the source code cannot be distributed as is because the end user will also need the interpreter to execute it.

High-level programming languages are typically designed to belong to one of two categories based on their method of execution: compiled or interpreted.

While there are a few languages capable of functioning as both, most are intentionally designed with this distinction in mind. The choice of whether a language will be compiled or interpreted is often a deliberate decision made by its creators during the design process.

## 1.1.6 What does an interpreter do?

Once you have written a program, it exists as a **computer file**. A computer program is essentially a piece of text, so the source code is typically saved in plain **text files**.

Important: The file must contain **pure text**, without any formatting such as different fonts, colors, embedded images, or other media. Next, you need to invoke the interpreter and direct it to read your source file.

The interpreter processes the source code in a manner familiar to Western conventions; reading from top to bottom and left to right. While there are exceptions to this rule, they will be discussed later in the course.

The interpreter’s first task is to check whether each line of the source code is correct, following the four aspects discussed earlier: alphabetical, lexical, syntactical, and semantical accuracy.

If an error is detected at any point, the interpreter immediately finishes its operation and outputs an **error message**. No further processing is performed until the error is resolved.

The interpreter will notify you about the location and cause of an error. However, these messages can sometimes be misleading. Since the interpreter cannot infer your exact intentions, it might detect errors at a point in the code that is distant from their true source.

For instance, if you attempt to use an undefined entity, the interpreter will flag an error at the location where the entity is being used, not where its definition or declaration was expected. In such cases, the actual issue often lies earlier in the code, such as the point where the interpreter should have been informed about the entity.

When a line of code passes all checks, the interpreter proceeds to execute it. This process—reading, checking, and executing—typically occurs for each line separately. In fact, the sequence can be repeated multiple times for certain sections of code, as parts of the program may be executed more than once during runtime.

It’s also possible for a significant portion of the program to execute successfully before the interpreter encounters an error. This behavior is a natural characteristic of the interpretation model.

You might wonder which model—compiling or interpreting—is better. There is no definitive answer. If one were clearly superior, the other would likely no longer be in use. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different contexts and purposes.

## 1.1.7 Advantages and Disavantages of Compilation vs Interpretation

### Advantages

| **Compilation** | **Interpretation** |
| :------------ | :--------- |
| - the execution of the translated code is usually faster. | - you can run the code as soon as you complete it. There are no additional phases of translation.|
| - only the user needs the compiler, the end user may use the code without it. | - the code is stored using a programming language not machine language. This means that it can be run on computers using different machine labguages. A user does not compile their code separately for each different architecture. |
| - the translated code is stored using machine language. Since it is very hard to understand it, the user's inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain their secret. | |

### Disadvantages

| **Compilation** | **Interpretation** |
| :-------------- | :----------------- |
| - the compilation itself may be a very time consuming process. You may not be able to run your code immediately after making an ammendment. | - Interpretation may not make your code faster. Your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast. |
| - you need as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on. | - both you and the end-user have to have the interpreter to run your code. |

Python is an **interpreted language**, which means it carries all the benefits and drawbacks typical of interpreted languages. Additionally, it introduces its own unique features to both categories.

To program in Python, you’ll need access to the **Python interpreter**. It’s an essential tool for running your Python code. The good news is that **Python is free**, making it accessible to everyone. This is one of its most significant advantages.

Historically, languages designed for interpretation have often been referred to as **scripting languages**, and the programs written in them are known as **scripts**.
